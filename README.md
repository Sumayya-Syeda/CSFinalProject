This is a calendar app to empower students and teachers to work more efficiently through sharing data. 


Students add classes and gain the ability to see a schedule. They will also have a personalized calendar that shows assignments. 
Students can inform teachers when they are the busiest.


The app aggregates student responses and assigns a "busy-ness" score that will let teachers know when students are busiest, thus allowing them to assign things at better times.
